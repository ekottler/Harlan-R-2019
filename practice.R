#Part 1: RStudio 101

#Welcome to R Studio!
#this is a script, saved as a .R file. While you can execute commands directly in the 
#console below, saving your code as a script allows you to come back to it and see what you 
#did at any time


# Annotating code

#Hashtags (#) allow you to make annotations in your .R file. The program will know to ignore
# this text, but these notes will help you later to remember what is happening in your code

#Exercise 1.1:
#Add three lines of notes below, stating what you had for breakfast today, the weather 
#outside and your favorite marine organism. 








# Executing code

#To run code from your R script, press Ctrl+Enter or manually click ->Run in the upper righthand corner of the R script. This executes the line or chunk of code the cursor is on, or any highlighted code.

#Exercise 1.2:
#Solve the following equation by copy/pasting it onto a new line
#w/o a hashtag, and executing the script : 453*4.6/2+34








#'<-' operator

#The '<-' operator assigns a name to any attribute and is used to store data while you are #working. This can be typed as either '<-' or '->' and the name that is being pointed to will #be assigned what is written on the other side.

#Exercise 1.3: execute the following:

test_score <- 34/35*100
test_score







#When you've reached this point, save the script as practice_YOURNAME.R, then put the green post-it-note on your laptop and wait until everyone is done

#Part II: Inputting and Organizing Data

# Step 1: Set working directory

#To be able to read in data, R needs to know exactly where the data are. By setting your #working directory in the very beginning of a script, you can give R the location to look for #files to read in. It is also the location where R will save files.

#getwd shows you what your current working directory is.
getwd()

#To set your working directory, modify the following code to the appropriate location on your computer where the sample_data.csv file is:

# On mac
setwd("/Users/Emily Kottler/Documents/data")

# On PC
setwd("C:/Users/Emily Kottler/Documents/data")






# Step 2: read in the data
# import the data file to a data frame called data with the read.csv function.

data <- read.csv("sample_data.csv")


#When you've reached this point, save the script then put the green post-it-note on your laptop and wait until everyone is done

#Part III: Working with data
#First, we'll load in the package "car" which has some functions we'll be working with
library(car)


#Summmary statistics

#Exercise 3.1:
#The following are useful functions for getting a sense of your data. Execute them, then #look at the help documentation for each.

head(data)
?head

summary(data)
?summary
#What information did the summary provide?





#Visualizing data

#you should also do some preliminary graphing to get a sense of your data
#simple functions like boxplot() can help out with this

#Exercise 3.2:
#create the following plots (look at the documentation for the functions) and take a look at your data. From these plots, do you think canopy cover and disturbance affect caterpillar density? Does it look like there are any outliers

boxplot(abundance ~ disturbance, data=data)
?boxplot


plot(data$canopy_cover,data$abundance)
?plot



#Statistical Assumptions

#Exercise 3.3
#does our response variable (caterpillar abundance) follow a normal distribution? If you are unsure of how to interpret the result, look at the shapiro.test documentation or online resources

shapiro.test(data$abundance)
#note that to just look at the abundance variable, we call our data file with a "$" and then the variable name


# we can also assess normality visually by looking at a Q-Q plot- a scatter that compares #the data to a perfect normal distribution. The scatter should lie as close to the line as #possible with no obvious pattern coming away from the line for the data to be considered 
# normally distributed. 
qqnorm(data$abundance)
qqline(data$abundance)

?qqline


#Exercise 3.4
#does our data meet expectations of homogeneity of variance?

leveneTest(data$abundance, group = data$disturbance)




#When you've reached this point, save the script then put the green post-it-note on your laptop and wait until everyone is done
###########################################################################################

#Part IV: Statistical analysis

#Run the following code to do an ANOVA. Based on the summary of the model, what are our findings?

model1 <- aov(abundance ~ disturbance * canopy_cover, data= data)
summary(model1)



#When you've reached this point, save the script then put the green post-it-note on your laptop and wait until everyone is done

############################################################################################
#Part V: Graphing

# In part III we did some initial graphing using the boxplot() and plot() functions

boxplot(abundance ~ disturbance, data=data)
?boxplot


plot(data$canopy_cover,data$abundance)
?plot


#now we'll be working with ggplot2 to make more customizable figures. We'll start by installing and loading ggplot2
install.packages(ggplot2)
library(ggplot2)

#Exercise 5.1:
#Here are the two plots I demonstrated in the powerpoint. Execute the code for them and make #sure it works, and that you understand how each component in the function is contributing to the graph output

#version 1
ggplot(data, aes(x=canopy_cover,y=abundance)) +
  geom_point()


#version 2
ggplot(data, aes(x=canopy_cover,y=abundance, color=disturbance)) +
  geom_point()


#Exercise 5.2:
#Attempt to re-create the figure on the powerpoint using a modified version of the function we've been using.

#HINT: you'll need the following elements: 
#functions:levels()
#ggplot elements:geom_smooth(),labs(),scale_color_manual(),theme_minimal()
